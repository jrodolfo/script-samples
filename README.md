# Scripts to run on Windows directly via command line or via Cygwin

You will find 3 examples of scripts for Windows/Cygwin:

1) Example 1 runs using Cygwin and it helps when you have several git maven projects with several developers working
on it, and you want to create backups and compare what changed from yesterday to today using file compare (Winmerge).

2) Example 2 runs using Cygwin, and it is a script that creates a react redux project.

3) Example 3 is a DOS script to delete folders recursively.
